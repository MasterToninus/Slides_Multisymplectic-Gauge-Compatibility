Title: Gauge transformations of multisymplectic manifolds and L_infinity observables

Abstract:
Multisimplectic manifolds are a simple generalization of symplectic manifolds where closed non-degenerate k-forms are considered in place of 2-forms.
A natural theme that raises when dealing with both symplectic and multisymplectic structures is to investigate what relationship exists between gauge-related multisymplectic manifolds, i.e. endowed with multisymplectic forms lying in the same cohomology class.

In this talk, we will focus on the L-infinity algebras of observables associated to a pair of gauge related manifold.
To date, no canonical correspondence is known between two gauge-related observables algebras.
However, we will be able to exhibit a compatibility relation between those observables that are momenta of corresponding homotopy moment maps (the higher analogue of a moment map in the multisymplectic setting).

Although this construction is essentially algebraic in nature, it admits also a geometric interpretation when declined to the particular case of pre-quantizable symplectic forms. This provides some evidence that this construction may be related to the higher analogue of geometric quantization for integral multisymplectic forms.

This is ongoing joint work with Marco Zambon.

## Update - July 2021

The slides in the state used for the presentation at the conference have been uploaded to [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353463068_Gauge_transformations_of_multisymplectic_manifolds_and_L_observables).

The handout version of this presentation has not been completed yet.

The goal is to write a long presentation with a complete handout when my transfer to Max Planck in Bonn is completed.


# Update - June 2022
A 1 hour talk by M.Z. based on the same work has been recorded on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weEVJ57b_No)

# Update - September 2023
New version ==msgauge-wurzburg.tex== for a workshop in [Wurzburg](https://www.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/mathematicalphysics/forschung/veranstaltungen/workshops-und-konferenzen/single/news/poisson-geometry-higher-structures-and-deformation-theory/). 
The presentation failed badly due to personal problems and miscalculation of time.

# Update - Febraury 2024
New version ==msgauge-Caprarola.tex== for a worskhop in [Caprarola](http://wpage.unina.it/francesco.dandrea/Caprarola2024/index.html).
