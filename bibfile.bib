@article{Rogers2010,
abstract = {A manifold is multisymplectic, or more specifically n-plectic, if it is equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential form of degree n+1. In our previous work with Baez and Hoffnung, we described how the `higher analogs' of the algebraic and geometric structures found in symplectic geometry should naturally arise in 2-plectic geometry. In particular, we showed that just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any 2-plectic manifold gives a Lie 2-algebra of 1-forms and functions. Lie n-algebras are examples of L-infinity algebras: graded vector spaces which are equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi identity. Here, we generalize our previous result. Given an n-plectic manifold, we explicitly construct a corresponding Lie n-algebra on a complex consisting of differential forms whose multi-brackets are specified by the n-plectic structure. We also show that any n-plectic manifold gives rise to another kind of algebraic structure known as a differential graded Leibniz algebra. We conclude by describing the similarities between these two structures within the context of an open problem in the theory of strongly homotopy algebras.},

@article{Carinena1991b,
abstract = {The general purpose of this paper is to attempt to clarify the geometrical foundations of first order Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories by introducing in a systematic way multisymplectic manifolds, the field theoretical analogues of the symplectic structures used in geometrical mechanics. Much of the confusion surrounding such terms as gauge transformation and symmetry transformation as they are used in the context of Lagrangian theory is thereby eliminated, as we show. We discuss Noether's theorem for general symmetries of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories. The cohomology associated to a group of symmetries of Hamiltonian or Lagrangian field theories is constructed and its relation with the structure of the current algebra is made apparent. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

@article{Gimmsy1,
abstract = {This is the first paper of a five part work in which we study the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian structure of classical field theories with constraints. Our goal is to explore some of the connections between initial value constraints and gauge transformations in such theories (either relativistic or not). To do this, in the course of these four papers, we develop and use a number of tools from symplectic and multisymplectic geometry. Of central importance in our analysis is the notion of the ``energy-momentum map'' associated to the gauge group of a given classical field theory. We hope to demonstrate that many different and apparently unrelated facets of field theories can be thereby tied together and understood in an essentially new way. In Part I we develop some of the basic theory of classical fields from a spacetime covariant viewpoint. We begin with a study of the covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, on jet bundles and multisymplectic manifolds, respectively. Then we discuss symmetries, conservation laws, and Noether's theorem in terms of ``covariant momentum maps.''},
